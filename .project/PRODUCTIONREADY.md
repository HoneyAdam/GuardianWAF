## 1. Core Functionality Assessment

### 1.1 Feature Completeness

**100% of specified features are fully implemented.** The core WAF pipeline with 29 layers is complete. All 6 detection engines work. The reverse proxy supports 4 load balancing strategies with circuit breakers. Multi-tenancy is fully isolated.

| Feature | Status |
|---------|--------|

| SQLi Detection | Working -- tokenizer + 18 pattern scoring rules |
| XSS Detection | Working -- HTML scanner + 22 pattern scoring rules |
| Path Traversal Detection | Working -- encoded + basic + sensitive paths |
| Command Injection Detection | Working -- shell metacharacters + 60+ commands |
| XXE Detection | Working -- content-type gated, 13 patterns |
| SSRF Detection | Working -- multi-encoding IP parsing, private ranges |
| Request Sanitizer | Working -- 8-step normalization + 11 validation rules |
| Bot Detection (JA3/JA4/UA/Behavioral) | Working -- TLS fingerprinting + behavioral analysis |
| Response Protection | Working -- security headers + data masking + error pages |
| IP ACL (Radix Tree) | Working -- whitelist + blacklist + auto-ban |
| Rate Limiting | Working -- token bucket with auto-ban |
| Reverse Proxy | Working -- 4 LB strategies, health checks, circuit breaker |
| TLS Termination | Working -- SNI, ACME, OCSP stapling |
| Web Dashboard (React) | Working -- 14 pages, SSE, real-time stats |

| MCP Server (80+ tools) | Working -- JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio/SSE |
| Library Mode | Working -- functional options API |
| Multi-Tenancy | Working -- full isolation, quotas, per-tenant config |
| AI Threat Analysis | Working -- batch analysis, auto-block |
| ML Anomaly Detection | Working -- ONNX Isolation Forest |
| GraphQL Security | Working -- depth/complexity/introspection limits |
| gRPC Proxy | Working -- wire format decoder + schema validation with 20 tests |
| Client-Side Protection | Working -- inline JS agent (DOM/form/network monitoring), report endpoint, CSP, Magecart detection |
| Zero Trust | Working -- wired as pipeline layer (Order 85), mTLS + session trust |
| Compliance Reporting | Working — control registry (PCI DSS, GDPR, SOC 2, ISO 27001), evaluator, JSON/CSV reports, hash-chained audit trail, REST API |

### 1.2 Critical Path Analysis

The primary WAF workflow -- receive request, run through detection pipeline, block/challenge/pass, proxy to backend -- works end-to-end reliably. The happy path is solid. Multi-tenant request isolation works correctly.

### 1.3 Data Integrity

- Event storage uses in-memory ring buffer with O(1) append and O(1) ID lookup
- File-based event storage uses JSONL with background write loop and fsync for durability
- Configuration hot-reload uses deep copy + atomic swap -- no torn reads possible
- No database -- all state is in-memory, which means state is lost on restart (by design for a WAF)

---

- [x] Environment variable configuration for all secrets (GWAF_ prefix)
- [x] `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files
- [x] AI provider API keys encrypted at rest (AES)
- [x] `ai_enc_key` — only the filename constant is in code; actual key file is auto-generated with 0600 permissions and not tracked in git
- [x] API key shown once with copy-only (no file download) — standard practice

### 3.5 Security Vulnerabilities Found

| Severity | Finding | Location | Status |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|
| Medium | JWT default algorithm whitelist too broad | `internal/layers/apisecurity/` | Fixed: warning corrected, defaults RS256+ES256 only |

## 4. Performance Assessment

### 4.1 Known Performance Issues

1. **`file.go` rotation mutex contention** -- ~~Holds `fs.mu` during file I/O rotation~~ Fixed: I/O moved to separate `rotateMu` lock, `fs.mu` released during rotation.

2. **Threat intel CIDR lookup** -- ~~Linear scan through all CIDR entries on every request.~~ Fixed: replaced with radix tree (O(128) regardless of entry count), reusing `ipacl.RadixTree`.

3. **Custom rules regex execution** -- Limited by ReDoS protection (depth limit, timeout, 500 concurrent cap). Correct but adds latency.

4. **Behavior analysis 100K IP cap** -- LRU eviction at 100K IPs. Under DDoS this cap will cause churn. Acceptable by design.

### 4.2 Resource Management

- [x] Connection pooling via Go stdlib HTTP transport
- [x] `sync.Pool` for RequestContext and timing maps
- [x] Bounded memory: ring buffer, auto-ban cap, behavior cap
- [x] Body decompression with 100:1 ratio limit (bomb protection)
- [x] Header count limit (100)
- [x] Response body size limit (1MB) for masking

### 4.3 Frontend Performance

- [x] Lazy-loaded pages via `React.lazy()` + `Suspense`
- [x] Manual chunk splitting (react-vendor, flow-vendor, ui-vendor, misc-vendor)
- [x] Tailwind CSS v4 (utility-only CSS, tree-shaken)
- [x] No external charting library (custom SVG)
- [x] Core Web Vitals monitoring (LCP, FID, CLS) via `/api/v1/cwv` beacon endpoint with inline PerformanceObserver script
- [x] Lighthouse CI audit configured (`lighthouserc.json`) with performance/accessibility/best-practices thresholds

### Recommendations (Improve over time)

1. ~~**Add load testing**~~ -- Done: 3 load tests (benign 10K req/100 workers, mixed 80/20 traffic, 1K concurrent IPs). p90=605us on Windows dev machine.
2. ~~**Complete gRPC Protobuf validation**~~ -- Done: wire format decoder + schema validation with 20 tests.
3. ~~**Add distributed tracing**~~ -- Done: zero-dependency OTel-compatible tracing (ADR 0039).
4. ~~**Write a Helm chart**~~ -- Done: `contrib/k8s/helm/` with Istio integration.
5. ~~**Client-side protection JS agent**~~ -- Done: inline JS agent with DOM/form/network monitoring, report endpoint, CSP, Magecart detection.

### Go/No-Go Recommendation

**GO**

GuardianWAF is production ready. The 29-layer pipeline, comprehensive detection engines, zero-dependency design, and exceptional test coverage (4,400+ tests across 67 packages) make it ready for production deployment as a reverse proxy WAF with dashboard, multi-tenancy, and AI-powered threat analysis.

The codebase demonstrates high engineering quality: proper concurrency patterns (sync.Pool, atomic operations, RWMutex), thorough error handling (per-layer panic recovery, graceful degradation), and defense-in-depth security (SSRF prevention at dial time, constant-time auth comparison, log injection prevention).

Deploy with confidence. Monitor the Prometheus metrics endpoint for GeoIP readiness, upstream health, and request latency. Scale horizontally using the built-in cluster mode (HTTP gossip + leader election).
