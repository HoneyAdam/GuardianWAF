GuardianWAF is a production-grade Web Application Firewall written in pure Go with zero external dependencies. It protects any HTTP backend — Node.js, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, .NET, or any other language — as a standalone reverse proxy, sidecar, or embeddable Go library. Docker auto-discovery, AI-powered threat analysis, and real-time dashboard included. Single binary, zero config required.

## Features

**Detection & Protection**
- Six attack detectors: SQL injection, XSS, path traversal, command injection, XXE, SSRF
- Tokenizer-based detection engine with configurable scoring thresholds
- JS Challenge (SHA-256 proof-of-work) for suspicious requests -- stops bots, passes real browsers
- Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm, per-IP and per-path scoping, and auto-ban
- IP whitelist/blacklist with radix tree for O(k) CIDR lookups (runtime add/remove via dashboard)
- Bot detection via JA3/JA4 TLS fingerprinting, User-Agent analysis, and behavioral tracking
- Response protection: security headers (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP), credit card/SSN/API key masking, stack trace stripping
- Branded HTML block page with request ID and threat score
- **Threat Intelligence**: IP and domain reputation checking with JSONL/CSV/JSON feeds, LRU cache, CIDR matching
- **CORS Security**: Origin validation with wildcard patterns, preflight handling, strict mode blocking

## Quick Start

### Standalone Reverse Proxy

```bash
# Install
go install github.com/guardianwaf/guardianwaf/cmd/guardianwaf@latest

# Create minimal config
cat > guardianwaf.yaml <<EOF
mode: enforce
listen: ":8088"
upstreams:
  - name: app
    targets:
      - url: "http://localhost:3000"
routes:
  - path: /
    upstream: app
dashboard:
  enabled: true
  listen: ":9443"
  api_key: "change-me"
EOF

# Run
guardianwaf serve
```

### Multi-Domain with TLS

```yaml
listen: ":8088"

tls:
  enabled: true
  listen: ":8443"
  http_redirect: true
  cert_file: "/etc/certs/default.pem"
  key_file: "/etc/certs/default-key.pem"

upstreams:
  - name: api
    load_balancer: weighted
    targets:
      - url: "http://api1:3000"
        weight: 3
      - url: "http://api2:3000"
        weight: 1
    health_check:
      enabled: true
      interval: 10s
      path: /healthz

  - name: web
    targets:
      - url: "http://web:8000"

virtual_hosts:
  - domains: ["api.example.com"]
    tls:
      cert_file: "/etc/certs/api.pem"
      key_file: "/etc/certs/api-key.pem"
    routes:
      - path: /
        upstream: api

  - domains: ["www.example.com", "example.com"]
    routes:
      - path: /
        upstream: web

routes:
  - path: /
    upstream: web
```

### Go Library (Middleware)

```bash
go get github.com/guardianwaf/guardianwaf
```

```go
waf, err := guardianwaf.New(guardianwaf.Config{
    Mode:      guardianwaf.ModeEnforce,
    Threshold: guardianwaf.ThresholdConfig{Block: 50, Log: 25},
    Challenge: guardianwaf.ChallengeConfig{Enabled: true, Difficulty: 20},
})
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
defer waf.Close()

http.ListenAndServe(":8088", waf.Middleware(myHandler))
```

### Sidecar (Docker / Kubernetes)

```bash
docker run -d -p 8088:8088 \
  guardianwaf/guardianwaf:latest \
  sidecar --upstream http://app:3000
```

### Docker Compose with Auto-Discovery

No upstream config needed -- just add `gwaf.*` labels to your containers:

```yaml
services:
  guardianwaf:
    image: guardianwaf/guardianwaf:latest
    ports:
      - "80:8088"
      - "9443:9443"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
      - ./guardianwaf.yaml:/etc/guardianwaf/guardianwaf.yaml:ro
    command: ["serve", "-c", "/etc/guardianwaf/guardianwaf.yaml"]

  # Auto-discovered backend (weight: 3)
  api:
    image: myapp:latest
    labels:
      gwaf.enable: "true"
      gwaf.host: "api.example.com"
      gwaf.upstream: "api-pool"
      gwaf.port: "3000"
      gwaf.weight: "3"
      gwaf.health.path: "/healthz"

  # Same upstream pool (weight: 1) = load balanced
  api-2:
    image: myapp:latest
    labels:
      gwaf.enable: "true"
      gwaf.host: "api.example.com"
      gwaf.upstream: "api-pool"
      gwaf.port: "3000"
      gwaf.weight: "1"
      gwaf.health.path: "/healthz"

  # Different service on different domain
  web:
    image: nginx:alpine
    labels:
      gwaf.enable: "true"
      gwaf.host: "www.example.com"
```

Scale instantly: `docker compose up -d --scale api=5` -- GuardianWAF detects all 5 instances automatically.

## Deployment Topologies

```
A) Standalone (replaces nginx):
   Internet --> GuardianWAF(:443 + :80) --> backend-api:3000
                                        --> backend-web:8000

B) Behind CDN:
   Cloudflare --> GuardianWAF(:8088) --> backends
   (TLS handled by Cloudflare)

C) Kubernetes Sidecar:
   Ingress --> GuardianWAF(:8088) --> app(:3000)

D) Embedded Library:
   Go app --> waf.Middleware(handler)
```

## Architecture

```
                          GuardianWAF Pipeline
                          ====================

  HTTP Request

  +-------------+   +------------+   +------------+   +------------+   +-----------+
                                                                              |
       +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
       |
       v
  +-----------+    +----------------+
  |    JS     |--->|   Upstream     |
  | Challenge |    | Load Balancer  |
  +-----------+    +----------------+
  (score 40-79)    |  |  |  |  |
                   v  v  v  v  v
                  Backend Targets
                  (health checked,
                   circuit breaker)
```

Each layer runs in order and can pass, log, challenge, or block the request. The detection layer runs 6 independent detectors (SQLi, XSS, LFI, CMDi, XXE, SSRF) and produces a cumulative threat score. Bot detection scores between 40-79 trigger a JavaScript proof-of-work challenge instead of blocking outright.

---

## Detection Engine

GuardianWAF uses a tokenizer-based scoring system instead of binary allow/block rules. HTTP requests are lexically decomposed into typed tokens, scored against attack patterns, and evaluated with configurable thresholds.

**Example: How scoring produces graduated responses**

```
Input: "O'Brien"
  -> Single apostrophe              score: 10
  -> Total: 10                      -> ALLOW (below log threshold)

Input: "' OR 'a'='a"
  -> Apostrophe + OR keyword        score: 30
  -> Tautology pattern              score: +55
  -> Total: 85                      -> BLOCK (above block threshold)

Input: Suspicious bot (UA: curl, high RPS)
  -> Bot score: 55                  -> JS CHALLENGE (proof-of-work page)
  -> Browser solves SHA-256 puzzle  -> Sets cookie, request passes
  -> Bot can't solve               -> Stays blocked
```

This graduated response eliminates most false positives while catching real attacks. Every blocked request includes the full score breakdown for transparent, data-driven tuning.

See [Detection Engine docs](docs/detection-engine.md) for the full pattern scoring table.

**Routing (`/routing`)**
- **Topology Graph** -- interactive React Flow visualization of the full request path: Clients -> WAF -> VHosts -> Routes -> Upstreams -> Targets, with TLS/SSL indicators, ports, health status, circuit breaker state
- **Backends** -- Docker-discovered services table + static upstreams, with container name, image, target URL, upstream pool, weight, health check path
- **Configure** -- form-based upstream/route/vhost management with save & rebuild

**AI Analysis (`/ai`)**
- Provider catalog (400+ from models.dev) with search and model details

## MCP Integration

GuardianWAF includes a built-in [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server that enables AI agents to monitor, query, and manage the WAF through structured tool calls. Two transports: **stdio** (local CLI) and **SSE** (remote HTTP with API key auth).

**15 MCP tools:**

| Category | Tools |
|---|---|
| Monitoring | `get_stats`, `get_events`, `get_top_ips`, `get_detectors` |
| Configuration | `get_config`, `set_mode` |
| IP Management | `add_whitelist`, `remove_whitelist`, `add_blacklist`, `remove_blacklist` |
| Rate Limiting | `add_ratelimit`, `remove_ratelimit` |
| Detection Tuning | `add_exclusion`, `remove_exclusion` |
| Testing | `test_request` |

**Claude Code (stdio):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "guardianwaf": {
      "command": "guardianwaf",
      "args": ["serve", "-c", "guardianwaf.yaml"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Desktop / VS Code (SSE — remote):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "guardianwaf": {
      "url": "http://your-waf-host:9443/mcp/sse",
      "headers": { "X-API-Key": "your-api-key" }
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask: *"Show me the latest blocked requests and blacklist the top attacking IP."*

See [MCP Integration docs](docs/mcp-integration.md) for the complete tool reference, SSE protocol details, and curl examples.

## Performance

GuardianWAF targets sub-millisecond p99 latency overhead per request.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| IP ACL lookup | < 100ns |
| Rate limit check | < 500ns |
| SQLi detection | < 200us p95 |
| All detectors combined | < 500us p95 |
| PoW verification (server-side) | ~60ns |
| Token generation (HMAC) | ~600ns |
| **Total pipeline (clean request)** | **< 1ms p99** |
| **Total pipeline (attack)** | **< 2ms p99** |
| Memory baseline (standalone) | < 30 MB |
| Memory baseline (library) | < 5 MB |
| Binary size (stripped) | ~15 MB |
| Docker image size | < 20 MB |
| Startup time | < 100ms |

Design choices for performance:
- Zero-allocation hot paths with `sync.Pool` for request contexts
- Atomic counters for statistics (no mutex contention)
- Radix tree for IP lookups (O(k) where k = address bits)
- Token bucket rate limiter (O(1) per check)
- State-machine tokenizer (no regex on the hot path)
- Circuit breaker with atomic state transitions (lock-free)
